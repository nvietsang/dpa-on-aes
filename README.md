# Introduction
This gives a tutorial of key recovery on AES-128 using Differential Power Analysis (DPA) and Correlation Power Analysis (CPA).

# Requirements
- [PyCryptodome](https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (for AES)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)

# Background
- Differential Power Analysis: [paper by Koccher *et al.*](https://paulkocher.com/doc/DifferentialPowerAnalysis.pdf), [video by David Wong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbqNCgVcXsM)

- Correlation Power Analysis: [paper by Brier *et al.*](https://www.iacr.org/archive/ches2004/31560016/31560016.pdf)

- Power Analysis Attacks: [book by Mangard *et al.*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-38162-6)

# To do
- Add a summary of theoretical explaination
